# 🚀 Interesting Projects on GitHub

## 👋 About Me

I'm a full-stack developer proficient in **Java**, **Python**, and **Go**, with some hands-on experience in **Rust**. On the frontend side, I mainly use **Flutter**, and I also have basic knowledge of **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**.

My academic background is in **Artificial Intelligence**, which I studied during my postgraduate education. I'm passionate about exploring cutting-edge AI tools, frameworks, and applications.

This repository is a curated collection of **interesting, inspiring, or technically impressive projects** I've come across on GitHub. I use this space to track and organize them across different fields.
